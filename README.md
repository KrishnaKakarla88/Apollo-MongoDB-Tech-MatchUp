# Apollo-MongoDB-Tech-MatchUp

This is a MERN-stack application, allows users to create a matchup between two technologies and vote on their favorite technology. The application uses a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server and Apollo Client. Also used React Router's `<Switch>` component in the routes.

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to see a list of matchups.

* As a user, I want to be able to create a matchup between two technologies.

* As a user, I want to be able to vote for one of the two technologies in the matchup.

* As a user, I want to see the current number of votes for each technology in the matchup.

* As a user, if I reach a page that doesn't exist, I want to see a 404 page.

## Acceptance Criteria

This project is complete when the following criteria are met:

* The `/` homepage route renders a list of technologies.

* The `/matchup` route renders a form to choose two technologies to create a matchup.

* The `/matchup/:id` route renders a matchup to vote on.

* An Apollo Server is set up to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data.

* Apollo Client is set up so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

* A 404 page `NotFound` is rendered if the user tries to access a page that doesn't exist.
